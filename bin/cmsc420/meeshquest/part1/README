Resources:
I have used ideas from the following sources to implement my PRQuadtree
- Online resource slides of PRQuadtree Implementation provided on the Wiki.
https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/meesh/cmsc420/Notes/neighbornotes/incnear.pdf
- My initial implementation used some of the ideas for implementing inserts on the PRQuadtree after stumbling on this github code,
but my current implementation has been reworked to be more efficient with what i already had in place, buy i still figured i should mention 
it in here to be safe. https://github.com/jahamed/Class-Projects/blob/master/CMSC420%20-%20Data%20Structures/PR%20Quadtree/bin/cmsc420/meeshquest/

I also received some helpful ideas on implementing my nearest cities command with the linked PDF files on the specification and the 
meeshquest wiki for the nearest city command.
